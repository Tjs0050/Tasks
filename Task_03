50%
ToMom <- length( grep("mom", Focus ) ) / length( Focus )
25%, these numbers do not match my predictions. 
ToMomMom <- length( grep("grandma_mom", Focus ) )/length( Focus )
ToMomDad <- length( grep("grandpa_mom", Focus ) )/length( Focus )
No. The focus is more related to the maternal grandpa than grandma. Focus is also related more to paternal grandmother. Basically, genetically this shouldn't happen because its so unlikely and it is such a random chance of allele assignment. 
Sibling_01 <- makeBaby(Brenda, Alan)
I think the focus should share around 80% with the sibling due to them having the same parents. That being said, the two actually share 94% of DNA.
ToSib <- length( intersect( Focus, Sibling_01 ) ) / length( Focus )
The focus shares around 5% of the DNA with all siblings because they still have the same parents. Genetic crossing will still occur in any alleles that come together. 
ManySiblings <- replicate( 1e3, length( intersect( Focus, makeBaby(Brenda, Alan) ) ) /length( Focus ) )
quantile(ManySiblings)
mean(ManySiblings)
The mean shares focus around 50.3% of the genes.

HWE <- function(p) {
	aa<- p^2

GenoFreq<- t(sapply(p, HWE))

I can understand the plot. If the freuency of allele a increases, it would folow expected paths. The less the allele is present the less it matches expectations.

Pop<- simPop(500)
points(Pop[,"freqa"], Pop[,"Genotypes.aa"]/500, pch=21, bg="red")
The points ARE on the line of the Hardy-Weinburg equilibrium.
Pop<- simPop(50)
points(Pop[,"freqa"], Pop[,"Genotypes.aa"]/50, pch=22, bg="red")
The points are more dispersed but they still fit our expectations. The smaller the population the more room for variables. 
library(learnPopGen)
x <- genetic . drift(Ne=200, nrep=5, pause=0.01)
PopSizes <- 5:50
Samples <- rep(PopSizes, 5)
tExt <- sapply(Samples, function(x) nrow(simPop(x, 500)))
Line <- lm(tExt ~ Samples)
summary(Line)
Line$coef
plot(Samples, tExt)
abline(Line)
Line2<- lm(tExt ~ Samples +0)
summary(Line2)
Aspopulation increases, the points go further away from the line we created. This means the allele is more present, and will most likley not be edited out.

This slope is lower for the robust line than the previous one.
